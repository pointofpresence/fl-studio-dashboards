1. Introduction
---------------
A Dashboard control is defined in a file with a .ini extension. 

There can be several sections that describe it:
- info (has to be present)
- properties
- items (only for some types of controls)

Each section has one or more values. A value looks like this: 
    name=value

A Dashboard control can use other files. At the moment, only bitmaps (.bmp, .jpg and .tga) are supported. 
Other files are referenced by their filename, relative to the Artwork folder under the Dashboard 
folder or relative to the location of the .ini file.  

Here are some examples:
- relative to the Artwork folder :  somedir\somefile.bmp  ==> Artwork\somedir\somefile.bmp
- relative to the .ini file      :  .\somefile.bmp        ==> Artwork\folder that the .ini is in\somefile.bmp



2. Remarks
----------
- don't put your own controls or bitmaps in the Default folder!
- a control is identified by its name, so make sure to give it one that's both descriptive and unique
- preferably put all controls of a certain group in a directory away from the rest
- if you don't specify a background image for a control, it's transparent. Not all controls support this very well
- take a look at the provided controls, they'll show you most of what you need to know



3. The [Info] section
---------------------
These are the values that can be defined in this section:

- Name       : 
    The name of the control. This has to be unique. Other than that there are no restrictions.
    Required.
- Kind       : 
    The kind of control. These are the possible values:
        0 = DigiWheel     
        1 = Slider        
        2 = Wheel         
        3 = Panel         
        4 = Switch        
        5 = Label         
        6 = Image         
        7 = Selector      
        8 = Patch selector 
        9 = Page selector  
    Required.
- Default    : 
    Indicates if this control is the default control for its kind (Default=1) or not (Default=0). 
    A default control is the one that is used if a specific control of this kind can't be found (because the user doesn't have it installed).
    Optional.
- Background : 
    This is a reference to the image file that will be used as background for the control. 
    If a background is specified, it determines the control's width and height.
    If you want to allow the user to make a background transparent, you have to specify an 8-bit .bmp file.
    Not all controls will use this value (see the explanation of each control kind for more information).
    Optional.
- Foreground :
    This is a reference to the image file that will be used as foreground for the control. This could be a knob for a slider, for example.
    Not all controls will use this value (see the explanation of each control kind for more information).
    Optional.



4. The [Properties] section
---------------------------
This section defines the values to be used for the properties of a control. These are all optional.
A full list is provided with the explanation for each control kind. These are the properties that are common to all controls:

- Width            : The initial width of the control. This value is only used if the control doesn't have a background.
- Height           : The initial height of the control. This value is only used if the control doesn't have a background.
- Resize           : This determines if the control is resizeable (Resize=1) or not (Resize=0). By default, controls are NOT resizeable.
- Caption Position : The position of the caption. Possible values: Left, Top, Right, Bottom
- Show Caption     : Possible values: True, False
- Transparent      : Possible values: True, False



5. The [Items] section
----------------------
This section is only valid for selectors and patch selectors. It defines the values that will be available in the selector.
The values are specified as a long list with this format (the = character is required):
    valuename= 
For patch selector controls, this can also include the bank and program numbers:
    valuename=bank msb, bank lsb, program number

Here's an example:

[items]
100% Left=
50% Left=
Centered=
50% Right=
100% Right=



6. Explanation of the specific controls
