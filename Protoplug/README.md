Protoplug is a VST/AU plugin that lets you load and edit Lua scripts as audio effects and instruments. The scripts can process audio and MIDI, display their own interface, and use external libraries. Transform any music software into a live coding environment!

Cross-platform: builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS. This means that all protoplug scripts are compatible with these platforms and can be loaded into a huge amount of audio software (glory to JUCE)

Fast: Use the speed of LuaJIT to perform complex DSP tasks in realtime.

Free and open source: The source is MIT-licensed. Hack away.
